This mod adds shells that can be fired from mortars that, upon detonation, release **FIVE ANGRY MANHUNTING RATS**. They can be crafted like any other shell, but made with rat meat instead of chemfuel.

**Q: CE?**
A: YES.  The shells can be made like any other shell with rat meat instead of FSX (I think) and have (MR) at the end of the label.  They also use the 81mm mortar.

**Q: Is this compatible with Meat Optimizations: C# Edition?**
A: Yes.  The ratshell recipe just uses the provided meat def.

**Q: Can I get a commission?**
A: Yes!  DM me on Discord or leave a comment and I'll address you ASAP.
